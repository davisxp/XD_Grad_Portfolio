## üßÆ Modelling Standards
- **Traceability:** every figure in notes ties to a cell; version tags (`v1.2`, `v1.3`) match.  
- **Hygiene:** stable 3-statement builds, transparent assumptions, named ranges only when additive.  
- **Controls:** dedicated **Checks** sheet ‚Äî must pass.  
- **Transparency:** key tables exported as CSV so they render natively on GitHub.  
- **Sources:** all assumptions footnoted (RNS, 10-K/AR, trial registries).  
- **Sensitivity:** WACC, PoS, synergy, leverage, and peak-sales toggles.
