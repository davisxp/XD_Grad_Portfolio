## Company of focus — Smith & Nephew (LSE: SN)

Selected for clear segment disclosures (Orthopaedics; Sports Medicine; Advanced Wound Management), a credible margin-improvement programme, and near-term newsflow. The capital-allocation backdrop (buybacks and bolt-on M&A options) provides a practical base for transaction case studies.

**Case modules**
- Equity Research — initiation and flash notes; primary DCF with comps cross-check.
- Merger (M&A) — accretion/dilution with synergy phasing, sources & uses, and PPA.
- LBO (sponsor) — division carve-out with TSAs/dis-synergies, leverage, MoIC/IRR, and covenant headroom.
- Public markets — long and short variants with a catalyst map.
- LevFin / DCM — debt-capacity analysis, rating-case vs base-case metrics, and covenant workbook.
- ECM — financing alternatives for acquisitions (debt-only vs debt + equity follow-on).

## Methods and standards

- **Valuation**: DCF (WACC build and long-term growth), Trading Comps, Precedent Transactions, SOTP for segment-level clarity, and rNPV for pipeline/new launches with stage-appropriate probabilities.
- **Transactions**: merger accretion/dilution with synergy timing and PPA; LBO with leverage layers, fees, cash sweeps, covenants; debt/equity raises with interest coverage, dilution, and rating headroom.
- **Sensitivity discipline**: local tables inside each model and a central scenarios hub (Base/Bear/Bull; WACC × LT growth; margin; capex/working capital; probability of success; launch timing; entry/exit multiple; synergy percentage; rates/FX).
- **Model hygiene**: FAST-style layout, named ranges, audit checks, error flags, and reproducible sourcing in `SOURCES.md`.
