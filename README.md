## Company of Focus — Smith & Nephew (LSE: SN.)

**Why :** Clear segment disclosures (Orthopaedics; Sports Med; Advanced Wound), credible operating-margin improvement plan, near-term newsflow. Evidences both **valuation** and **speed of analysis**. Their capital-allocation backdrop (buybacks, bolt-on M&A optionality) also makes it ideal for transaction packs.

**Contained Within:**
- **Pitch 1 — Equity Research:** **Initiation of Coverage** on Smith & Nephew, plus **2 Flash Notes** reacting to near-dated announcements; primary **DCF** with comps cross-check; CSV exports for web viewing.
- **Pitch 2 — Merger (M&A):** Buyer–target case with **Sources & Uses**, **PPA**, **synergy phasing**, debt schedule, and **EPS accretion/dilution** sensitivities; deck + one-pager.
- **Pitch 3 — LBO (Sponsor):** **Carve-out LBO** of a Smith & Nephew division (e.g., Advanced Wound) with TSA costs, dis-synergies, leverage, **MOIC/IRR** and covenant headroom.
- **Pitch 4 — Buy-Side (Long/Short):** Two public-markets theses on the same model: **Long** (execution + margins + allocation) and **Short** (execution/china pricing risk) with catalyst paths.
- **Pitch 5 — LevFin / DCM:** **Debt-capacity** note and a draft **term sheet** to finance a bolt-on; rating-case vs base-case metrics and a covenant headroom workbook.
- **Pitch 6 — IPO / Follow-On:** Financing alternative analysis for a sizeable acquisition (**debt-only vs debt+equity** follow-on), showing dilution, free-float, and cost-of-capital impacts.
