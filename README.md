- `templates/` — public templates (initiation, flash, rNPV scaffold, model skeletons) used to build the above.
- `docs/` — brief methodology and assumptions write‑ups.

> **No MNPI**: All work is based on public information only. This repo is for educational/employment samples and is **not investment advice**.

## How to navigate
1. Open the latest **initiation PDF** in `notes/initiation/` for a top‑to‑bottom view.  
2. Open `models/*` for the underlying Excel with an audit trail and checks tab.  
3. Flash notes show my real‑time reaction and model deltas.

## Method summary
- **Valuation:** rNPV for clinical assets (PoS by phase/indication), triangulated with comps/DCF for later‑stage names.
- **Accounting & controls:** clean 3‑statement structure, versioned assumptions, checks tab, and sensitivity tables.
- **Reproducibility:** templates in `templates/` ensure each artefact follows a consistent structure.
